When Voldemort realised that the young man had a position at Hogwarts, he took immediate possession of Quirrell, who was incapable of resisting. … Quirrell is, in effect, turned <b>into a temporary Horcrux by Voldemort</b>. He is greatly depleted by the physical strain of fighting the far stronger, evil soul inside him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_looking_in_the_window_of_Hagrid%E2%80%99s_hut_when_the_dragon_hatched></span>Who was looking in the window of Hagrid’s hut when the dragon hatched?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Birth.
