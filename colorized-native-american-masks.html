But to Indigenous cultures, these masks are more than just pieces of carved wood.</p><p>For Native Americans, masks and headdresses are considered to be the physical embodiment of the spirits of their ancestors.</p><p>"Once they are created through the instruction of the almighty and are blessed, they become a living entity," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Vincent Randall</a>, a Yavapai-Apache tribal member who works on repatriation of Native artifacts. "They still have that power. That's why it's very potent. We don't fool around with them."</p><p>The value of masks to Native Americans is akin to that of sacred texts for religious worshippers. That is why these masks are handled with the utmost respect. To do otherwise, it is believed, could inflict unwanted bad karma.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-270569 alt="Native Bird Masks" width=900 height=591 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/native-bird-masks.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-270569 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Edward S. Curtis Collection/Library of Congress</span><span class=caption-body>Cultural masks can take the shape of figures from nature, mythical beings from lore, and other representations.</span></p><p>For many tribes, shamans are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">regarded as conduits</a> between the tribe and the spirit world. It's the shamans who carve elaborate masks — or at least supervise their carving.</p><p>The use of these masks vary depending on each tribal culture, though there are some similarities between regions. For the Yup'ik and Inupiaq peoples of Alaksa, masks are an essential part of winter ceremonies where tribal members dress up in their headgear to reenact the adventures of hero-ancestors and spirits from their lore.</p><h2>Different Tribes, Different Designs</h2>Chuna McIntyre, a Yup'ik cultural consultant, explains the history behind a mask being restored at the Met Museum.<p>Native American masks are commonly used to facilitate the spiritual connection between the wearer of the mask and the spirit world. They're often worn in special ceremonies and dances.</p><p>They're traditionally made out of wood, leather, feathers, beads, straw, fur, leaves, and other natural materials. But as contact with European settlers grew, Native Americans also added metal carving tools and synthetic paint to the mix.</p><p>The natives of North America are a diverse group of communities with their own individual customs and cultures, and this diversity extends to the use and design of their tribal masks.</p><p>For the Kwakiutl, who live in what is now Canada's British Columbia, masks are meant to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offer a temporary vessel</a> for supernatural entities. They are also an expression of the internal transformation experienced by the mask-wearer.</p><p>Mask patterns and designs among Northwest Coast tribes bear some similarities, but these tribes do not share the same myths nor do they use the masks in the same way during ceremonies. Each mask acquires a different historical meaning based on the generations that pass them down.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-270460 alt="Nunivak Tribe Member" width=600 height=755 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nunivak-tribe-member.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-270460 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Edward S.

Some of those stereotypes were enhanced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">through photographic manipulations</a>.</p><p>More critically, his work ignored the violence suffered by Native Americans at the hands of the U.S. government at the time. In the early 20th century, Native American children were taken from their parents and forced into boarding schools, where they had to cut their hair and weren't allowed to speak in their native tongues.</p><p>"[Stereotypes evoked by Curtis' work] have been recreated, updated and reinforced by more recent generations, so that most Angelenos and Americans as a whole still don't see American Indians as modern people, only as relics of the past," wrote Navajo filmmaker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela J. Peters</a>.</p><p>But the Native American communities that Curtis declared a "vanishing race" are still very much alive today.</p>Wendy Red Star is among the Native American artists whose work challenges the stereotypes of Native identity.<p>A shift in the public's understanding of Native American culture has allowed Native artists like the late <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beau Dick</a>, whose colorful tribal masks are still among the most lauded among modern Native artifacts, to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">command attention</a> in the mainstream art scene.</p><p>"My style is sometimes referred to as 'Potlatch Style' as it comes from a tradition of ceremony which requires many masks to be made in a short period of time," Dick said. "It takes many years of practice and an understanding of balance in order to create a work that appears finished in a natural and instinctive manner, without seeming overthought."</p><p>Native American masks have seen a rise and decline in popularity among the mainstream public and the Native communities. But even after centuries, these spiritual emblems are still a powerful part of tribal culture.</p><p>Next, find out the tragic history behind <a href=#>the forgotten Bear River Massacre</a> and read the real story of <a href=#>Squanto</a>, the Native American behind the first Thanksgiving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyku8uoqaKylZl6r63Toq2eZZGisrO1wpqlZqWRqLi0</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcolorized-native-american-masks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcolorized-native-american-masks.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcolorized-native-american-masks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcolorized-native-american-masks.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcolorized-native-american-masks.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcolorized-native-american-masks.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maribel-guardia-shares-swimsuit-photo-from-family-beach-trip.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maribel-guardia-shares-swimsuit-photo-from-family-beach-trip.html>Maribel Guardia Shares Swimsuit Photo From &amp;quot;Family Beach Trip&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./92987-singer-mary-j-blige-celebrates-50th-birthday-stunning-bikini-photos-html.html>Singer Mary J.
