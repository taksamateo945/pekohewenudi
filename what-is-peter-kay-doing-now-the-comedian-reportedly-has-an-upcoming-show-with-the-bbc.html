After winning the North West Comedian of the Year Award, he went on to win Channel 4’s&nbsp;So You Think You’re Funny contest,&nbsp;and the following year, he earned a nomination for a Perrier Award.&nbsp;</p><p>Kay’s show&nbsp;The Peter Kay Thing&nbsp;generated two spin-offs,&nbsp;Phoenix Nights&nbsp;and&nbsp;Max and Paddy’s Road to Nowhere,&nbsp;all of which were massive hits.&nbsp;Peter Kay’s Car Share,&nbsp;a sitcom ran by BBC between 2015 and 2017, won Peter BAFTA TV Awards for Best Male Comedy Performance and Best Scripted Comedy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Peter reportedly has an upcoming show planned with the BBC</h3><p>Peter Kay dropped off the public limelight in late 2017, canceling his love tours and outstanding work commitments. He returned to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media in March 2018 to announce a charity screening</a> of&nbsp;Peter Kay’s Car Share.&nbsp;</p><p>“Thank you very much for supporting the Lily Foundation raising money for mitochondrial disease,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he told the Blackpool audience</a>.&nbsp;“Very kind of you. I appreciate it. Enjoy the last ever episode of Car Share. Don’t tell anyone the end. Or tell anyone about any hedgehogs.”</p><p>A year later, he was spotted over the bank holiday weekend on a tram tour around Blackpool. In 2020, he made a short appearance on&nbsp;The Big Night In,&nbsp;a show to raise funds for coronavirus relief.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans are eager to know when one of the most loved British comedians will return to the screen. An exact return date is unknown, but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>&nbsp;reported that Kay has a show in the works with the BBC. Per the outlet’s source, the BBC will allow Peter to run on his preferred schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>“A conversation has been had between Peter and the BBC,”&nbsp;the source said.&nbsp;“There is no rush and whatever happens will always be dictated by Peter but a new project has been discussed. It’s exciting news for Peter’s fans, who have yet to see the void left by Car Share filled.”</p><p>Peter’s return to the screen would be huge, considering how popular he is. In early 2021, Peter appeared on Cat Deeley’s Radio 2 debut to catch up and engage in friendly banter. His fans flocked on Twitter to express joy at hearing Peter’s voice and wit again.&nbsp;“The wit and warmth he exudes is such a tonic in these troubled times; he has been much missed,”&nbsp;a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user named Fi Beau wrote</a>.</p><h3>Kay cancelled his projects in late 2017 due to ‘unforeseen family circumstances’</h3><p>In December 2017, Peter posted a statement on Twitter stating that he’d canceled all his projects due to ‘unforeseen family circumstances.’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The statement read</a>:</p><p>“My sincerest apologies. This decision has not been taken lightly and I’m sure you’ll understand my family must always come first. I’ve always endeavored to protect my family’s privacy from the media. I hope that the media and the public will continue to respect our privacy at this time. Once again, I’m very sorry.”</p><p>Peter has often spoken about his desire to spend more time with family. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The&nbsp;Daily Mirror</a>&nbsp;in 2003 that he appreciated his success and the fortunes it brought, but it wasn’t worth it if it deprived him of family time.&nbsp;“But I promise, if it had meant being away from the people I love, I wouldn’t have bothered,”&nbsp;he said.</p><p>In his 2006 book&nbsp;The Sound of Laughter,&nbsp;Peter stated that he’d met celebrities who regretted not spending more time with their families.&nbsp;“I’ve met so many older actors and comedians who’ve told me they wished they’d spent as much time with their kids as they did chasing money,”&nbsp;he wrote.&nbsp;“You’ve got to draw a line but it’s a gamble. I’ve tried to balance it by writing my book.”</p><p>His comedic aspirations matter, but not as much as spending time with his wife and kids. Kay prefers anonymity as he enjoys life surrounded by family love. He hasn’t ruled out a comeback to the stage, however. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The&nbsp;Daily Mirror</a>&nbsp;in 2017:</p><p>“As terrifying as it is, when it works there’s nothing more fun and exciting. Plus, a lot has happened in the last eight years, with Trump, Twitter and my Nan getting her front bush trimmed at the age of 96. I can’t wait to get back up on stage.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thenetline.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iWwW610mannqyVp3qsrdhmm6ihnpx6r7vWZquhnV2YvK6xw6KYp2Wimr2wvtOem6WxXZ2utHnAp2SuqJOkuqq6xmaqoaenYsSqwMdmq6GdXZevpHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-peter-kay-doing-now-the-comedian-reportedly-has-an-upcoming-show-with-the-bbc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-peter-kay-doing-now-the-comedian-reportedly-has-an-upcoming-show-with-the-bbc.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-peter-kay-doing-now-the-comedian-reportedly-has-an-upcoming-show-with-the-bbc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-peter-kay-doing-now-the-comedian-reportedly-has-an-upcoming-show-with-the-bbc.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-peter-kay-doing-now-the-comedian-reportedly-has-an-upcoming-show-with-the-bbc.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-peter-kay-doing-now-the-comedian-reportedly-has-an-upcoming-show-with-the-bbc.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2846365-report-brian-wright-to-be-promoted-to-spurs-gm-rc-buford-getting-new-role.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2846365-report-brian-wright-to-be-promoted-to-spurs-gm-rc-buford-getting-new-role.html>Brian Wright Promoted to Spurs GM; R.C.
