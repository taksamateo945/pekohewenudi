His birth year is not known, but it has been mentioned that he and his wife are of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>same age,</a> which makes his birth year 1970 as is hers. Alexis is of Afro-American ethnicity, but details of his parents and family have not been made public.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Appearance_of_David_Alexis>Height, Weight, and Appearance of David Alexis</span></h2><p>David Alexis is tall and heavily built, with long black hair which he wears in a signature braids style which he has not changed since he got into the public eye. His personal style is minimal and understated, with jeans, black leather jackets, and mostly monochromatic ensembles. He also wears a pair of black round sunglasses coupled with a black hat, which he has consistently maintained as his signature look, even when he appeared in the red carpets since the ‘80s.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=David_Alexiss_Career_as_a_musician>David Alexis’s Career as a musician</span></h2><p>Alexis keeps a rather low profile in his steady career working as a musician, songwriter and a music producer since the late ‘80s. He also works as a personal music trainer for aspiring musicians, and supported his wife’s short venture into music as well. He has been <a rel=nofollow href=#>credited</a> plenty of times as a songwriter and a music composer during his career, for over 20 years.</p><h2><span id=When_did_David_Alexis_get_married>When did David Alexis get married?</span></h2><p>David Alexis met Mädchen Amick who was his neighbor at the time, in 1987, and when both were struggling teenage artists in Los Angeles. Their relationship started off as a friendship, and Alexis helped Amick with her singing as a personal music trainer. Their friendship eventually grew into a romance, and the couple married on 9 December 1992 after four years of dating, and they are evidently still happily married after 26 years with a daughter and a son. They have not had any affairs or scandals as a couple during the long period of time they have been together, which is a rare success story in Hollywood.</p><h2><span id=David_Alexiss_Family_and_Children>David Alexis’s Family and Children</span></h2><p>David Alexis and Mädchen Amick welcomed their first child on 5 July 1992, a son they named Sylvester Time Amick-Alexis. Soon after their marriage, they had their daughter Mina Tobias Amick-Alexis on 2 September 1993 – the 25-year-old Mina is now an aspiring singer, and released her first single -“Freedom” – in 2015. The music video for the song had an endearing homage to “Twin Peaks”, which was the turning point of her mother’s career and rise to fame.</p><h2><span id=What_is_David_Alexiss_Net_worth>What is David Alexis’s Net worth?</span></h2><p>Although not being a part of any popular music studio, or taking credit publically for his work, the net worth of David Alexis is estimated by sources at over$4 million, and it’s reported that his <a rel=nofollow href=#>annual income</a> is close to $400,000.

Playing these scenes as a 40+-year-old actress created some controversial dialogue among critics, but she addressed them saying that it was all about the character, and that David was extremely supportive of his wife’s career choices.</p><h2><span id=David_Alexis_in_Social_Media>David Alexis in Social Media</span></h2><p>Alexis keeps a low profile when it comes to his personal life, as well as his professional life, and does not have known profiles in any of the major social media platforms.
