In the series, he played the supporting character of </span><b>Landy Clarke</b><span> who is the best friend of Matt Saracen (a football quarterback). Landy joins a football team later on in the series. Since he is a good football player in real life, he was better than most other actors and didn’t use any body-double for his stunts. He got hurt real bad when he had to do a scene with his co-star Taylor Kitsch requiring more than ten stitches.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It was because of this dedication of his, he got the recognition he deserved after playing in Friday Night Lights.

He was the first cast in Battleship as </span><i><span>Boatswain Mate Seaman Jimmy ‘Ordy’ Ord</span></i><span> which was a big hit at the box office.
