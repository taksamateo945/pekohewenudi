He later discovered his mother had burned the letters.</p><h2>She had lost the baby</h2>“She didn’t want me to marry a Japanese girl,” Mann said.<p class=align-left>A final letter arrived for Mann and Yamaguchi wrote that she had lost the baby and married someone else.</p>“It was over, it set in that idea that I abandoned her, just wore me out,” Mann said. “That’s not an honorable thing to do,” he added.<p class=align-left>Over the years, Mann’s son, Brian, supported his father’s lifelong quest to find his lost love because he wanted to clear his concience.</p><h2>Mann’s long search of hope</h2>“I think it was a combination of guilt, confusion and sadness. We owe it to them to see if this is truly the Peggy that my dad is looking for,” he said.<p class=align-left>In early May, Mann’s long search, of heartbreak and hope, went around the <a href=#>world</a> and was shared by Japanese media. Viewers and readers got in on the search, emailing and posting obituaries and photos, wondering if they had found Yamaguchi.</p><p class=align-left>It turns out that when Duane Mann was in Iowa searching for Yamaguchi, she was closer to him than he could have imagined.</p><p class=align-left>Rich Sedenquist, Yamaguchi’s son, was eventually found, contacted and asked if she remembered Duane Mann.</p><h2>Yamaguchi had moved on</h2>“One way to find out,” he said.<p class=align-left>So, he took his headphones over to his mother and played the video clip of Duane Mann from the news article. She right away said that she remembered him because he really loved her.</p><p class=align-left>Yamaguchi was alive and had moved on with her Navy husband whom she married in 1955. She lived in the same Michigan community where she raised her three sons.</p>“He’s able to fulfill his dream, his lifelong dream to find the woman that he met and fell in love with and, 70 years later, what a wonderful story,” Sedenquist said.<h2>Discovered by a Canadian woman</h2><p class=align-left>An article dated February 3, 1956, from the local Escanaba newspaper, The Daily Press, was instrumental in finding Yamaguchi.</p>It was discovered by a Canadian woman who saw Duane Mann’s story online and felt compelled to act. “I feel like it cut me right to my soul,” she said.<p class=align-left>The 23-year-old is a researcher for the History Channel and she found the old newspaper article with the headline Tokyo bride makes life in Escanaba.</p><h2>Carrying around the heartbreak</h2><p class=align-left>That article provided the last name and an address to go by.</p>“I cannot imagine carrying around that heartbreak for 70 years,” Wong said. “I really hope this is just that opportunity to get closure and really like a release all those years of worrying about it,” he added.<p class=align-left>Upon meeting, Duane Mann and Yamaguchi spontaneously started reminiscing about their special time in Japan.</p>“I was scared at first, I thought my mother and Duane wouldn’t talk like they did but when they started smiling and talking it was all worth it. it was all worth it for me,” Sedenquist said.<p class=align-left>Brian Mann, Duane Mann’s son had similar sentiments.</p>“It’s a great example, as my dad has always been telling me, follow your heart, be a kind person and not be afraid to take a step other people won’t. It’s authentic to me," he added.<h2>Mann strong impression on Yamaguchi</h2><p class=align-left>Duane Mann told Yamaguchi he remembers her with photos in his billfold wallet, which he has carried around for 70 years.</p><p class=align-left>Duane Mann also left a strong impression on Yamaguchi. Sedenquist’s middle name is Duane.</p>“It just came to light how I really got that name, and it wasn’t by happenstance, it was for a reason I believe,” Sedenquist said.“It’s really been a freeing experience for me,” said Mann.<h2>Aww: Groom cries in emotional video, gets comforted by his loving bride</h2><p class=align-left>In more sweet relationship news, <strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that a video of a Nigerian <a href=#>groom weeping hard</a> at his traditional <a href=#>wedding</a> occasion has stirred mixed reactions on social media.</p><p class=align-left>Overwhelmed with emotions, the groom on his knees wept facing his bride who seemed more composed at that moment.</p><p class=align-left><strong>New feature:</strong> <i>check out news exactly <strong>for YOU </strong>➡️ find "Recommended for you" block and enjoy!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLi70aWbaK2jZH5zhJRvbGato2K%2FpsDIq5ydZaOkuaW1xKtkq52lo7a1scNmo6irpGK5sMLEZpifrJWnenh8jLKcmqqjYsCmrdGcn6Kml2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f128565-us-retired-soldier-reunited-lost-love-after-70-years-searching.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f128565-us-retired-soldier-reunited-lost-love-after-70-years-searching.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f128565-us-retired-soldier-reunited-lost-love-after-70-years-searching.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f128565-us-retired-soldier-reunited-lost-love-after-70-years-searching.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f128565-us-retired-soldier-reunited-lost-love-after-70-years-searching.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f128565-us-retired-soldier-reunited-lost-love-after-70-years-searching.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jamel-shabazz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jamel-shabazz.html>Jamel Shabazz's Most Iconic Images From The Streets Of New York</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bullied-broke-built.html>How Being Bullied Broke But Built Me</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bullied-broke-built.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
