He earned a staggering name as well as fame from his prolific career. As peeking at Toni Kukoč’s personal life, he is married to his beautiful wife, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Renata Kukoc</strong></a>.</p><p>The lovely couple is blessed with two adorable children; son, <strong>Marin Kukoč</strong>, and daughter, <strong>Stela Kukoč</strong>. Even though Toni Kukoč is a famous celebrity, people probably don’t know much about his kids. So, let’s get straight into the article and know more about Toni Kukoč’s children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marin_Kukoc_Pursued_Basketball_Career_As_His_Dad_Did></span>Marin Kukoč Pursued Basketball Career As His Dad Did<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Toni Kukoč’s son with wife, Renata, is Marin Kukoč and was born on July 31, 1992, at Highland Park, Illinois.

He played at the Full Package Exposure League before.</p><p>Marin Kukoč’s dad might have taught him very well, giving great tips about the game. His high school coach, <strong>Paul Harris</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">was impressed with him and said</a>,</p><p>“He has a very high skill level so he can go under the post and score. He can handle the ball and score off the dribble and has worked hard to improve his three-point shooting as well.”</p><p>In 2010, Marin announced his commitment to Pen over other Ivy League schools. According to ESPN, he played 33 games for the 2011-12 season and averaged 2.5 points per game. However, some sources stated that <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Marin Kukoč was no longer</a> the Penn men’s basketball team member due to his struggling back injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Marin-Kukoč-injury.jpg><p>But after Marin recovered, he was a member of the Croatian U19 National Team and played at the U18 European Championship in 2012. Since he posted <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a YouTube video</a> in 2016, he probably played basketball in 2016 as well. However, as of 2020, Toni Kukoč’s son apparently has a life of privacy and secrecy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Toni_Kukocs_Daughter_Stela_Kukoc_Is_A_Volleyball_Player_As_Well_As_Coach></span>Toni Kukoč’s Daughter, Stela Kukoč Is A Volleyball Player As Well As Coach<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gorgeous Stela Kukoč is Toni Kukoč’s daughter whom he had with his beautiful wife, Renata.
