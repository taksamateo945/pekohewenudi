Jane.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">The 1997 film starred Demi Moore playing the first woman to enter Navy SEAL training.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Rock presumably made the joke because of Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, as Moore famously shaved her head for the role.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Pinkett Smith had previously been candid about her struggle with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that attacks hair follicles, by sharing social media posts about her hair loss and the decision to shave her head.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur"><b class="Dyur KYSJr">MORE: Oscars drama shines light on Jada Pinkett Smith’s alopecia, condition that causes hair loss</b></p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Following the infamous slap, Smith apologized, resigned his membership with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the organization behind the Oscars — and the Academy banned the actor from any Academy event or program, including the Oscars, for 10 years.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Smith also apologized to Rock’s mother, Rosalie, because he saw an interview she did and how hurt she was by the situation. He also apologized to Rock’s brother, Tony, saying their previously “great relationship” was now “probably irreparable.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“That was one of the things about that moment I just didn’t realize, and, you know, I wasn’t thinking, but how many people got hurt in that moment,” Smith said this week of the altercation.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">As for how he feels looking back on the incident, Smith said he’s spent the last few months “replaying and understanding the nuances and the complexities of what happened in that moment.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“I’m not going to try to unpack all of that right now,” he said. “But I can say to all of you, there is no part of me that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment. There’s no part of me that thinks that’s the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur"><b class="Dyur KYSJr">SEE ALSO: Will Smith banned from Academy events, programs for 10 years for slapping Chris Rock at Oscars</b></p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Another question Smith tackled was if Pinkett Smith told him to do something after rolling her eyes at Rock’s joke. To that, he said a firm “no.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“I made a choice on my own, from my own experiences, from my history with Chris. Jada had nothing to do with it,” he said, apologizing to his family for his actions and the negative attention they received because of them.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“I’m sorry, babe. I wanna say sorry to my kids and my family for the heat that I brought on all of us,” he said.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Smith then addressed his fellow nominees and winners, saying “it really breaks my heart to have stolen and tarnished your moment.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">He specifically addressed Questlove, who accepted the award for best documentary for his film, “Summer of Soul,” moments after the slap.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“I can still see Questlove’s eyes,” he said. “You know, it happened on Questlove’s award and, you know, it’s like, ‘I’m sorry’ really isn’t sufficient.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">He then shared what he would say to those who “looked up” to him before the moment or those who expressed that his behavior that night “let them down.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“So there’s two things: One, disappointing people is my central trauma,” he said. “I hate when I let people down, so it hurts.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Smith said it impacts him “psychologically and emotionally” to know that he “didn’t live up to people’s image and impression” of him.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">“…I am deeply remorseful and I’m trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself,” he stated. “I’m human, and I made a mistake. And I’m trying not to think of myself as a piece of s—.”</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB Dyur">Addressing those disappointed members of his fan base, he added, “I know it was confusing, I know it was shocking, but I promise you, I am deeply devoted and committed to putting light and love and joy into the world. And, you know, if you hang on, I promise we’ll be able to be friends again.”</p><p>Copyright © 2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp565rXnSpqCtoF2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdpMCkrdGsZKykkaV6orzOpaagoaqawG7AzmaaoaqZqHqzu8KkZKKmXaOyuHnVopuep18%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-smith-addresses-oscars-slap-apologizes-to-chris-rock-in-new-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwill-smith-addresses-oscars-slap-apologizes-to-chris-rock-in-new-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwill-smith-addresses-oscars-slap-apologizes-to-chris-rock-in-new-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwill-smith-addresses-oscars-slap-apologizes-to-chris-rock-in-new-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-smith-addresses-oscars-slap-apologizes-to-chris-rock-in-new-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-smith-addresses-oscars-slap-apologizes-to-chris-rock-in-new-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ross-dickerson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ross-dickerson.html>Ross Dickerson- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Dating</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ellen-degeneres-wife-accident.html>Who Was Ellen Degeneres Ex-Wife Anne Heche &amp;amp; How Did She Die?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ellen-degeneres-wife-accident.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
