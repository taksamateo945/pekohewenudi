Born on June 18, 1976 in Ada, Oklahoma, he is the son of Dorothy and Richard Shelton. His mother owned a beauty salon, and his father sold used cars for a living. Growing up, his uncle taught him to play the guitar, and that is when he began to take an interest in music. Within three years, he was a 15-year-old musical prodigy who had already written his first songs and was certain he wanted to find a career in the music industry. The singer moved to Nashville when he was only 17-years-old so that he could pursue his musical career. His brother had been killed in an automobile accident a few years before and he did not do much more than look forward to a day when he could leave home and find his dreams.</p><p>Blake Shelton moved to Nashville and that’s when he realized that a successful career in country music required a lot more than just becoming famous. He worked as a publishing company and sought fame on the side, and that’s when he finally decided to sign with Sony Music. It was 2001 when he finally found his big break, though. This time it was with a company called Giant Records, who wanted him to sing for them. That’s when he was offered a chance to sing the song, “I wanna talk about me,” which the company decided wasn’t the right first song for Blake Shelton and gave it, instead, to country music legend Toby Keith.</p><p>Blake Shelton’s first hit, “Austin,” was number one for five weeks, and that’s when he finally became famous. Over the years, he became even more famous as he released more music and more singles that all reached number one at some point. To date, Blake Shelton has released nine studio albums, including a Christmas album. His tenth album is slated for release at some point in 2016, and it has yet to be named – or if it has, the name has not yet been released.</p><p>His personal life has been a bit of a gossip-monger’s dream over the past few years. He married his longtime girlfriend in 2003, but he met Miranda Lambert in 2005. The two allegedly began seeing one another behind his wife’s back and that’s when he filed for divorce, which was finalized in 2006. Blake Shelton married Miranda Lambert in 2011, and the couple announced and finalized their divorce only four years later in the summer of 2015. He is now dating famous singer Gwen Stefani, with whom he met while coaching up and coming talent on the hit reality show, “The Voice,” after she and her husband of many years announced their own divorce.</p><p>He’s been a coach on “The Voice” since 2011, and he has no desire to leave the show as yet. He’s had success with it, and it has helped him to stay relevant over the past few years along with his music.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiZpZmbmnq0tMSlq6imXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblake-shelton-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fblake-shelton-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fblake-shelton-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fblake-shelton-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblake-shelton-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblake-shelton-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bay-area-foot-care-san-leandro-ca.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bay-area-foot-care-san-leandro-ca.html>Podiatrist Near Me | Bay Area Foot Care San Leandro, CA</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alva-inga.html>Alva Inga - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alva-inga.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
