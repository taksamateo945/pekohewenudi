Originally from the U.S. state of Georgia, the celebrity we know today as LeeAnn Kreischer was born in Bowdon to parents whom she has never disclosed details about them to the public. However, it is known that LeeAnn was raised in her birth city Bowdon in Carroll County, Georgia. She also had her first education here before she relocated to Los Angeles to pursue greener pastures.</p><h2><strong>She Began Her Career as an Actress and Script Writer in Los Angeles</strong></h2><p>LeeAnn started her career journey as an actress and script writer.&nbsp;Though exact details of LeeAnn Kriescher’s education are not yet known, it is however believed that they form the building blocks that make her the successful woman she is today pursuing diverse careers. She started off as a writer before venturing into other career interests which can also be attributed to her relationship with Bert.</p><p>Straight out of Georgia, LeeAnn secured her first job in Los Angeles as an actress in a short film titled “Destiny Stalled” in the year 2000. In the film, she portrayed the character of a nurse. The film which had the likes of Robert Glen Keith and Robert Glen Keith in lead roles was directed by Susan Johnson who also co-wrote the scripts with Charlie Terrell.</p><p>Following the success of this work, next came LeeAnn Kreischer’s job as a writer in her first Hollywood film. She worked as a writer on the teen comedy “My Biggest Fan” in 2002. In this project, she worked alongside the likes of Chris Trousdale (main character), Michael Criscione, Michael Meyer, Liz Sinclair, and others. The film was later released on May 18, 2005.</p><h2><strong>LeeAnn Met Bert Kreischer While Working in Hollywood</strong></h2><p>In the pursuit of her career and also in the pursuit of his, LeeAnn and Bert Kreischer met in Hollywood. They didn’t think much of each other in their first meeting and this also repeated itself in their second meeting but things turned around for good by the time they met for the third time. The duo met then at a bowling center during which Bert had a good conversation with LeeAnn and began seeing her from another perspective.</p><p>He took a keen interest in her and even went on to ask LeeAnn’s friend and roommate for his love interest’s phone number. However, contrary to what LeeAnn expected and indeed what every other lady would expect, Bert didn’t call her for up to 5 days. Unknown to her, Bert had never asked any girl out on a date and was in fact at a loss on how to go about it.</p><h2><strong>She Became Bert Kreischer’s Wife in December 2003</strong></h2><p>LeeAnn Kreischer and Bert Kreischer walked down the aisle sometime in December 2003 and have been together since then.</p><p>Though details of their marriage were not made publicly available, the couple’s marriage has been admired by all who get to know about them.

Be that as it may, she has her nicknames given as IBay, Baby I, I, and Brownie.</p><p>Like Georgia, Ila is still a student (high schooler) and has not yet started pursuing a career actively. But already, she is showing interest in modeling, and going by her body stats, Ila is sure to make a killing in the career.</p><p>She currently stands at 5 feet 2 inches and weighs a decent 52kg.
