This means that she is about 178 centimeters or 1.78 meters tall. Although she is not the tallest woman in America, Kelly’s height is a pretty impressive one, especially when we compare it with the average height for American women.</p><p>The average height for women in the USA is approximately 5 feet 4 inches. This means that Kelly is about 6 inches taller than an average woman in the United States, and the height difference would be very noticeable when she is among women of average height.</p><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis Height Compared to Her Former Spouse</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis has been married three times; first to Boyd Black (1979 to 1981) then to Fred Tillman (1989 to 2002) and lastly to Melanie Leis from 2010 to 2011.

Here’s how her height compares to that of her former spouse, Melanie Leis.</p><h3><strong>Kelly McGillis’ Height Vs Melanie Leis’s Height</strong></h3><p>Kelly McGillis is taller than Melanie Leis by 7 inches. Melanie stands at approximately 5 feet 3 inches, which is the equivalent of 1.6 meters or 160 centimeters. This means that, unlike McGillis, Melanie is about 1 inch shorter than the average American woman.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/me3-1.jpg alt="Kelly Mcgillis Height, Weight, and Body Measurements" width=606 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>For a little background information, Leis and McGillis got married in 2010 and the marriage came to an end in about a year in 2011. Although their marriage was short-lived, the pair were romantically involved a long time before that. While speaking on the nature of their relationship, Leis revealed that she and Kelly first met at a movie theater in the early 2000s.</p><p>Soon after that, they started dating and even moved in together. However, their relationship was off-camera and there were no pictures of them together. After some time the duo broke up, but later reunited in 2009. They dated for some time and later officially tied the knot on September 15, 2010. Sadly, the following year, the couple decided to nullify their marriage for some undisclosed reasons.</p><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis Height Compared to Other Famous Celebrities</strong></h2><p>With her height, there are not that many women and men who can boast of being conspicuously taller than the iconic actress. Below is a comparison between Kelly’s height and that of some of her co-stars.</p><h3><strong>How Tall is Kelly McGillis Compared To Tom Cruise?</strong></h3><p>Kelly McGillis is 3 inches taller than Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise is 5 feet 7 inches, or equivalently 1.7 meters or 170 centimeters tall. This means that he is shorter than McGillis by 3 inches, and the height difference is pretty obvious when they stand beside each other.</p><p>Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis co-starred in the 1980s blockbuster drama series, Top Gun which was first released in 1986. While Cruise played the role of a Naval Aviator, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, McGillis is cast as Charlotte “Charlie” Blackwood, an astrophysicist and Top Gun Civilian who later becomes entangled with the misunderstood Maverick.</p><p>In 2022, Tom Cruise was contracted to make a reappearance as the lead character Maverick in the Top Gun sequel, Top Gun: Maverick. On the other hand, Kelly revealed that she was not called back for a reappearance in the movie due to the many changes her body had gone through since the first season.</p><h3><strong>Kelly McGillis’s Height Compared to Harrison Ford’s</strong></h3><p>Harrison Ford whom Kelly McGillis starred alongside in the 1985 drama crime film titled Witness stands at a height of 6 feet or the equivalent of 1.85 meters. At this towering height, Kelly stands shorter than the ace actor by at least 3 inches which might seem almost negligible when the two stand close to each other.</p><p>In the film Witness, while Harrison played the character of John Book, Kelly acted as Rachel Loop and both of them played main roles alongside the likes of Lukas Haas, Viggo and Danny Glover, etc.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/c0c2d375dc6c978b941284c7b9788dba.jpg alt="Kelly Mcgillis Height, Weight, and Body Measurements" width=1761 height=1191 sizes="(max-width: 1761px) 100vw, 1761px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2><strong>Kelly McGilis’ Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Although she was once a sexy slim goddess in her earlier days, age and time have put the star actress through some noticeable physical changes. Kelly McGilis’ current body measurements are; chest 37 inches, waist 27 inches, and hips 38 inches.</p><p>With these body measurements, the once thin screen goddess has moved up in her size and she now has a beautifully curvy body type. Although her body size is not the ideal type popular among other actors, the 53-year-old actress is very confident in her naturally aging body and works hard to keep it fit and healthy.</p><p>When it comes to her weight, Kelly weighs about 74 kilograms or approximately 163 pounds. Although she appears to be a bit on the big side, her weight balances out well with her height, and her body mass index is about 23.4m, and consequently, her weight is just about normal and not a cause for alarm.</p><h3><strong>Is Kelly McGillis on a Diet?</strong></h3><p>Kelly McGillis is not on any specific diet. Although fans have been expressing concern over her weight gain, she is very content with her body and has not conceded to taking any artificial measures to bring down her weight. Kelly only strives to maintain a healthy lifestyle even without a strict diet plan.</p><p>While speaking on her weight loss, Kelly said that she had realized that one of the keys to losing weight faster is by trying not to take in more calories than you burn. To achieve this, McGillis took out junk food from her diet&nbsp; and also cut down her daily calorie intake by 800 calories; from 2000 to 1200 calories every day. And judging by her recent pictures, we can say that her diet plan is paying off quite well, even though it is not very strict.</p><h3><span><strong>Kelly McGillis’s Workout Routine</strong></span></h3><p>Once&nbsp;in the entertainment industry, celebrities are constantly faced with the pressure to maintain a perfect face and body. While some famous personalities bulk under this pressure and take extreme measures like very strict diet plans and rigorous workout routines to maintain their youthful looks, few others do not let the craze for perfection get to them.</p><p>Among these is Kelly McGillis. While her natural physical alterations have cost her some major career achievements, the iconic star has not let that push her to the edge. She strives only for an age-appropriate healthy lifestyle. The beautiful actress is content with just having a healthy diet and does not try too much to maintain a young physique with extreme workout activities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmpJ2cocZuucKgoKWkmah6qbHIoJ%2BtZaeatqi002aYp5xdl7ylxYymnJqrpaeyrrHNrapo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkelly-mcgillis-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkelly-mcgillis-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkelly-mcgillis-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkelly-mcgillis-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkelly-mcgillis-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkelly-mcgillis-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cherry-creek-holiday-market.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cherry-creek-holiday-market.html>Cherry Creek Holiday Market</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-marshall-tucker-band-announces-the-infinite-road-tour-for-2023.html>The Marshall Tucker Band Announces The Infinite Road Tour For 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-marshall-tucker-band-announces-the-infinite-road-tour-for-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
